abstract = "Few studies have investigated the influence of body posture on speech production and especially on its acoustic parameters. This study examines the influence of supine and upright position on the formants (F1 and F2), of the 10 French oral vowels, on F0, on speech rate and on the characteristics of the electroglottographic signal. The small differences observed between the two conditions highlight the speakers' ability to compensate for the effects of gravity in an attempt to preserve the acoustic characteristics of speech."
