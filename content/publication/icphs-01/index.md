# Abstract and optional shortened version.
abstract = "A deep convolutional neural network was trained to classify 45 speakers based on spectrograms of their productions of the French vowel /ɑ̃/ Although the model achieved fairly high accuracy – over 85 % – our primary focus here was phonetic interpretability rather than sheer performance. In order to better understand what kind of representations were learned by the model, i) several versions of the model were trained  and  tested  with  low-pass  filtered  spectrograms with a varying cut-off frequency and ii) classification was also performed with masked frequency bands. The  resulting  decline  in  accuracy  was  utilized to spot relevant frequencies for speaker classification and voice comparison, and to produce phonetically interpretable visualizations." 
#abstract_short = "Like every late L2 - learner, French native speakers are characterized by a foreign accent. The literature emphasizes that the vowels / ɪ /, / ʌ / and / æ / in particular are pronounced ''à la française''."
