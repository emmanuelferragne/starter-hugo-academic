abstract = "This  paper  studies  the  use  of  a  lip  retractor  as  a  potential  technique  for  phonetic  studies  involving perturbation. This device is currently used by participants of the internet sensation, the so-called ''no lips'' or ''mouth guard'' challenge. Wearing the device restricts the use of the lips during speech. We present  acoustic  and  articulatory  data  from  four  speakers  of  British  English.  Accelerometer  data  is used to assess the dynamics of the jaw and ultrasound tongue imaging gives us insights into potential compensation strategies,  specifically for the  /u/ (GOOSE) vowel. Ultrasound data revealed that three speakers  showed  signs  of  tongue  retraction  for  perturbed  /u/,  which  was  not  reflected  in  the corresponding acoustic data. This study highlights the limitations of a purely acoustic analysis of the effects  of  perturbation  on  speech.  Despite  certain  limitations,  we  conclude  that  the  use  of  the  lip retractor is a promising technique for future lip perturbation studies."
