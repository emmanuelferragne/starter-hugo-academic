1. __Interpolate__

When tenors sing __unwritten high notes__ (like the high C in _Di Quella Pira_ from Verdi's _Il Trovatore_ or in _No, no principessa altera_ from Puccini's _Turandot_), these notes are said to be __"interpolated"__. As someone who is used to working with acoustic signals, time series and numbers, I spontaneously interpret "to interpolate" as "to add a number or item into the middle of a series, calculated _based on the numbers or items before and after it_" (Cambridge Dictionary Online, my emphasis). 

When singers "interpolate" high notes, they actually go beyond the notes that occur before or after them; in other words, if we were to follow the mathematical definition, __it would be more accurate to use the verb "to extrapolate"__. As it turns out, the non mathematical definition of "interpolate" is "to add something in the middle of a text, piece of music" (Cambridge Dictionary Online), which is consistent with what tenors do when they sing those high Cs. 

So maybe we should say that they interpolate extrapolated notes? Well... the Oxford English Dictionary has an obsolete definition for "extrapolate", by analogy with the non mathematical definition of "interpolate": to remove a passage from a text. This is quite confusing because __"to extrapolate" can therefore have two opposite meanings: to add or to remove something...__

2. __Downtuning arias__

It is not uncommon in opera to __downtune arias containing very high notes__. Quite a few versions of _Di Quella Pira_ or _Che Gelida Manina_ from _La Bohème_ sung a half step lower than the composer originally intended can be found on Youtube, even when performed by the greatest. On a side note: the pitch of Youtube videos may sometimes not be faithful to the recording due to errors in playback speed or  sampling rate errors during digitization (which amounts to the same thing). Also: orchestras used to have a range of different references pitches (in other words the same note could be slightly lower or higher depending on the orchestra). 

Now if, like me, you don't have perfect pitch, it __doesn't make much of a difference whether the tenor belts out a B4 or a C5__, provided the note displays the right colour and strength. For example, in the following video, Luciano Pavarotti sings a B4 (live) to gather his soldiers: the incredible quality of his note would clearly convince me to follow him :grinning_face_with_big_eyes:

Now, __I've always assumed that it was the highest note in an aria that caused singers to tune it down__. But it is not always the case. Towards the end of [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X8ac6mOSw74), the tenor Michael Fabiano, while analyzing the aria _Che Gelida Manina_ and the famous high C on the words "la speranza", says that he now tranposes it down not because of the high C. __He actually finds it hard to go from [i] to [ɔ] in "chi son" in the original key__, i.e., going from Db4 on "chi" to Bb4 on "son". He says he finds it "much easier" to do the same thing a half step below. 

3. __The French Liaison__

For me, the Spanish tenor Alfredo Kraus was probably one of the most intelligible non French tenors when he sang in French. It is therefore __very surprising that in the aria _Pour mon âme_ in Donizetti's _La fille du régiment_ he would fail to produce the "compulsory" liaison between "mon" and "âme"__. Actually, from [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYm9BlduuD4), it is clear that Kraus produced the liaison at the begining of the aria (which is vocally less demanding) but not when singing the high Cs. This suggests that __he knew the correct pronunciation but technical constraints led him to favour singability over diction__.

As I was listening to Kraus's interpretation of _Je crois entendre encore_ from Bizet's _Les pêcheurs de perles_ [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3rVmE0Jubo), I noticed (in addition to his singing the wrong words in the first line) that __he had a liaison between "nuit" and "enchanteresse"__. I first thought it was a mistake but then I listened to a version by Alain Vanzo (who was a francophone) and the liaison was there too. I am quite certain that __noone would have a liaison here in spontaneous speech__ (but of course, one would object that noone would use the word "enchanteresse" in spontaneous speech anyway :thinking_face:). I found an explanation in _French Diction for Singers: A Handbook of Pronunciation for French Opera and Mélodie_ by Jason Nedecky. On page 40: 
> _Liaison_ is also occasionally made from a small list of singular nouns in order to maintain _legato_ where an especially unpleasant _hiatus_ would otherwise occur. This type of _liaison_ was more readily accepted in the past. It is most often possible in well-known phrases from the repertoire, and should only be made very lightly. 

And then the author draws a __short list of the most common fossilized phrases belonging to this cateogry, and "ô nuit enchanteresse" from _Les Pêcheurs de perles_ happens to be on the list__.
