The Birmingham in the title of this post (a line from a [famous song](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sweet_Home_Alabama)) doesn't refer to the birthplace of heavy metal music in the UK. Instead, it's Birmingham, Alabama, with the last syllable pronounced like the word *ham* (i.e. with a full quality) while the town in the UK has a reduced vowel: /bɜːmɪŋəm/. 

The pronunciation of place names (aka toponyms) is hard to predict from the spelling in some cases. This small sample of places in the UK should convince the skeptics:


| Place Name   |    Canonical pronunciation      |  Likely spontaneous (wrong) pronunciation |
|:----------:|:-------------:|:------:|
|Reading| /ˈrɛdɪŋ/ | /ˈriːdɪŋ/ | 
|Cambridge |  /ˈkeɪmbrɪdʒ/ | /ˈkæmbrɪdʒ/ |
|Leicester| /ˈlɛstə/ | ? |
|Greenwich| /ˈɡrɪnɪdʒ/ | /ˈɡriːnwɪtʃ/ |
|Chiswick| /ˈtʃɪzɪk/ | /ˈtʃɪzwɪk/ |
|Berkshire | /ˈbɑːkʃə/| /ˈbɜːkʃə/ |
|Gloucester|  /ˈglɒstə/| ?|
|Loughborough| /ˈlʌfbərə/| /ˈlɒxbʌrə/ ?|
|Cholmondeley| /ˈtʃʌmli/| ??? |

## French place names

I'm a native speaker of French but I'm not 100% sure about the pronunciation of:

- Metz : is it /mɛs/, /mɛts/, /mɛz/ or /mɛdz/ ?
- Bruxelles : /bʁysɛl/ or /bʁyksɛl/; it seems people favour the former.
- Auxerre : /osɛʁ/ or /oksɛʁ/; again, people seem to prefer the counterintuitive pronunciation (the grapheme \<x\> being most often /ks/ elsewhere)

A frequent difficulty is whether the last letter should be pronounced:

| Place Name   |    Pronounce final letter?  |
|:----------:|:-------------:|
|Anvers| + |
|Arnas| + |
|Avoriaz| - |
|Chamonix| - |
|Gex| + |
|Juliénas| - |
|(Les) Vans| + |
|Paris| - |
|Ruoms| + |
|Saint-Genie**z**(-d'Olt) | ? |
|Saint-Geni**s**(-les-Ollières) | - |
|Saint-Jean-de-Lu**z**| + |

## Bourg-en-Bresse

Bourg-en-Bresse is a small French town (40,000 inhabitants) not too far from where I live. Being a ''neighbour'', I know how the locals pronounce the name of their town.

<div class="mapouter"><div class="gmap_canvas"><iframe width="598" height="541" id="gmap_canvas" src="https://maps.google.com/maps?q=bourg-en-bresse&t=&z=5&ie=UTF8&iwloc=&output=embed" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" marginheight="0" marginwidth="0"></iframe><a href="https://www.crocothemes.net"></a></div><style>.mapouter{text-align:right;height:541px;width:598px;}.gmap_canvas {overflow:hidden;background:none!important;height:541px;width:598px;}</style></div><br>

The most intuitive pronunciation would be /buʁɑ̃brɛs/; this is what most non-locals say. In French the word *bourg* is a common noun that refers to a small town. It is pronounced /buʁ/, so /buʁɑ̃brɛs/ is really what you'd naturally come up with. 

But the canonical pronunciation is **/buʁkɑ̃brɛs/** with a rather unexpected ''linking'', probably historical, /k/. I can't think of any other French word ending in graphic \<g\> that would give rise to a /k/ before a vowel. Here the /ʁ/ is enough to comply with a tendency in languages to avoid a succession of 2 vowels. And even if it was not enough, \<g\> would generate /g/, not /k/. 

In oral speech, Bourg-en-Bresse is often shortened to Bourg. And guess what... yes, it is pronounced /buʁk/. This is really the ultimate shibboleth to recognize insiders! 

To a certain extent, it sounds as if the linking consonant is preserved while it is no longer needed. Although it is a slightly different case, it somewhat reminds me of the persistent /r/ in some speakers of British English in the word *idea/r/*. This one is a linking (linguists call it ''intrusive'') /r/ that is used in sequences like *the idea /r/ of*, *the law /r/ of*, etc. And sometimes, it ends up being produced as part of the word without a phonological need for it: ''it's a good idea/r/''. 

Back to place names: if you want to get the pronunciation right, the sensible thing to do is to always look it up in a dictionary or ask the locals.
